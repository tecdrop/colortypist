Imagine this: you open an app and type a color name or code. Instantly, your screen is filled with that color. It's like magic, but it's not. It's Colortypist.

Colortypist makes exploring, learning, and experimenting with colors as easy as typing. Choose from a variety of color formats like color names, hex triplets, RGB, and HSL. The standard set of colors includes the 148 web color names, but the color party doesn't stop there. You can opt for more in the settings.

Ever wondered what makes up your favorite color? Dive into the Color Information screen and get all the details. You'll see your color in different formats, including its luminance and brightness. Sharing your color findings with friends is just a tap away.

The Color Reference list serves as your color dictionary. Tap on a color, and it fills your screen. It's that easy. And the Preview Color screen? It's your personal color zen space, free of distractions.

Colortypist is not just an Android and Windows app. It's also a progressive web application, so it runs smoothly in your web browser, no matter the operating system - Android, ChromeOS, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, you name it. The best part? Colortypist is open-source! This means you can dive into its code, give us a star on GitHub, or even join us in developing it further.

Colortypist is more than an app. It's a color exploration tool, a learning companion, and a source of inspiration. Get started today and let your screen come alive with the colors you type!
