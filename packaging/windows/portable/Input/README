Welcome to Colortypist
----------------------------------------

Imagine this: you open an app and type a color name or code. Instantly, your
screen is filled with that color. It's like magic, but it's not. It's
Colortypist.

Colortypist makes exploring, learning, and experimenting with colors as easy as
typing. Choose from a variety of color formats like color names, hex triplets,
RGB, and HSL. The standard set of colors includes the 148 web color names, but
the color party doesn't stop there. You can opt for more in the settings.

Ever wondered what makes up your favorite color? Dive into the Color Information
screen and get all the details. You'll see your color in different formats,
including its luminance and brightness. Sharing your color findings with friends
is just a tap away.

The Color Reference list serves as your color dictionary. Tap on a color, and it
fills your screen. It's that easy. And the Preview Color screen? It's your
personal color zen space, free of distractions.

Colortypist is not just an Android and Windows app. It's also a progressive web
application, so it runs smoothly in your web browser, no matter the operating
system - Android, ChromeOS, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, you name it. The best
part? Colortypist is open-source! This means you can dive into its code, give us
a star on GitHub, or even join us in developing it further.

Colortypist is more than an app. It's a color exploration tool, a learning
companion, and a source of inspiration. Get started today and let your screen
come alive with the colors you type!
